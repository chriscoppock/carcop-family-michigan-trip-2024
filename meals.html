    <h2>Sunday</h2>
    <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Quiche and pastries from local Swedish Bakery. <br>Super yummy and only open on the weekends. A couple of people can go pick it up and bring back to the house.</p>
    <p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Sandwiches, fruit, chips, other snack items to go in a cooler for the beach.</p>
    <p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Chicken, corn risotto, with a cherry tomato sauce, and side salad.</p>
    <p><strong>Dessert:</strong> Popsicles</p>

    <h2>Monday - Boat Day</h2>
    <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Yogurt, granola, fruit, bagels</p>
    <p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Same to go stuff from above</p>
    <p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Burgers, fruit, chips, peach burrata salad</p>
    <p><strong>Dessert:</strong> Stripped Rich Cake - Coppock family first time. I thought this would be fun but we can do something else too</p>

    <h2>Tuesday</h2>
    <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Eggs and bacon and fruit</p>
    <p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Same to go</p>
    <p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Out to <a href="">Journeymans</a> - if reservations work or somewhere else but out to dinner one night. <br>Also checking with them on if reservations work better for Monday or Tuesday. <br>We would do dessert ice cream out the same night since we would be out and about.</p>
    <p><strong>Dessert:</strong> Out to a local ice cream place.</p>

    <h2>Wednesday</h2>
    <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> French toast casserole and fruit <br>(this instead of pancakes because without a griddle there it will take way too long)</p>
    <p><strong>Lunch:</strong> To go same as before</p>
    <p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Coppock family pizza place</p>

    <h2>Additional Dessert Option</h2>
    <p>Another possible dessert is we could do a fire one night and smores on the beach so instead of popsicles or cake, we could do that option.</p>
    <p>The sunsets are amazing at the beach so we might go down most nights to see the sunset and then we can come back to the house or dessert or stay and do a fire pit.</p>
