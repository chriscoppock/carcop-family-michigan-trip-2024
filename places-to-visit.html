    <h2>Beach</h2>
    <p>
        There are two beaches you can use: South Beach and North Beach. While North Beach is closer to our house, we typically go to South Beach because it’s a little larger. Cell service is pretty bad at the beach, so plan accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is easiest to drive the golf cart there, but if you want to take your vehicle, there is a vehicle hang tag in the top drawer to the left of the dishwasher. Please return this before you leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pro tip: the back seat on the golf cart will flip over to make a ‘bed’ that you can use to more easily transport beach gear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunsets from the South Beach deck should be on your ‘must do’ list.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to have a fire on the beach, please ‘leave no trace’ and try to build where it seems like a fire was previously built.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note the gate to the beach gets locked at 10pm, so if out late, don’t get a golf cart or vehicle locked in for the night.
    </p>
    <p>If it is super warm you can swim at night, fingers crossed. I have never done that but Jenny and her family has lots.</p>
